# Harness Example

This example demonstrates simple helper functions that call the OpenAI API and an MCP server.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```

## Running Checks

Run all linters and tests with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

You can also run the tests directly using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```
